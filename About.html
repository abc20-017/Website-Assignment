      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Population</h1>
      <p>The city of Barcelona is the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia of Spain and it is the second-largest city in Spain with a population of 1.7 million within the administrative limits. Barcelona’s urban area has a much larger population of 5.6 million sprawled over 101 square kilometers. The city’s urban population makes it the sixth most populous in the EU. The city is also the largest on the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
      <p>Barcelona is a unique and architecturally stunning city and the only city in the world that was awarded a Royal Gold Medal for architecture by the Royal Institute of British Architects. Immediately recognizable from above, Barcelona's unique layout and design has meant that it continues to attract tourists, students, and new residents to this beautiful (and ancient) city. Experts predict that Barcelona’s population will reach 5.8 million in the greater urban area by 2035.</p>

The space, which charts Barça’s history, offers visitors a chance to see all the trophies that the club has won and there are also areas devoted to the club’s most famous players.</p>
     <p>2)<b>Picasso Museum</b>-This is a centre of reference in terms of understanding the formative years of the great painter from Malaga, who established close links with the city of Barcelona during his adolescence and youth. The permanent exhibition contains more than 4,000 works.The <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d190165-Reviews-Museu_Picasso-Barcelona_Catalonia.html">Museu Picasso</a> symbolises the love affair between the city of Barcelona and the painter. The Ruiz Picasso family came to Barcelona at the end of the 19th century, when Pablo was only 14.14 Immediately he started studying at the Escola de Belles Arts de la Llotja fine arts academy and began his career as a painter. 18 When he was 18, he experienced the opening of the Quatre Gats cafe, which became one of the Catalan intellectual centres of that time. The young Picasso painted the cafe's menus in exchange for holding an exhibition there.</p>
     <p>3)<b>La Rambla Street</b>-<a href="https://barcelonando.com/la-rambla/">La Rambla</a> is the most famous street in Barcelona, and thus the first destinations to visit in the city. The street is about 0.75 miles (1.2 km) long, going from Port Vell and Christoper Columbus Colum to Placa de Catalunya. It is crossing the old city of Barcelona, which makes it close to many of the city’s sites and a great area for accommodation. While some might say it’s too touristic, La Rambla is fun to stroll on and absorb the Barcelona vibes. Restaurants, Cafes, Ice cream shops – make a stop and watch the locals and visitors passing by, or gaze at the human statues that are an integral part of the street’s view.
     <p>4)<b>Boqueria Market</b>-As you make your way up from the port towards <a href="https://www.barcelonaturisme.com/wv3/en/page/1241/placa-de-catalunya.html">Plaça Catalunya</a>, on your left side is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Boqueria">La Boqueria Market</a>.

With more than 300 food stands that sell meat, cheese, fruits, and veggies, it is the biggest food market in Europe. Enter under the iconic metal gate, and find your place for a cold smoothie or some tapas with a glass of cava. Pinotxo Bar, on the right side, as you enter, is a good recommendation.
